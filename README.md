# Why?

Thought I'd learn something new. Interested in mobile development, using backend technologies.

# What am I using?

I'm using .NET 6 LTS on Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition

# How to run it

With that in mind, you should be able to just open up the solution using Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition. You might need to go to you Visual Studio Installer in order to modify your SDK to include MAUI.

# What is this?

Just a normal generic notetaking app made from following the microsoft docs for now.
